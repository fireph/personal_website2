            Hi, I am a software engineer! I enjoy biking, hiking, and video
            games. But most of all, I love to code. I am a proficient javascript
            web developer (front-end and back-end), Hack/PHP developer, 3D
            graphics programmer, and Android developer. I currently strive to
            master the art of crafting amazing games and 3D graphics
            experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I often go to hack-a-thons and have built some awesome projects over
            the years, ranging from music websites to Bash scripting. You can
            check out some of my favorites that I have built on my site!
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it is circuit prototyping or GLSL shader development, I am
            always up for the challenge of learning something new and honing my
            skills. I have honed my Android and 3D graphics knowledge for the
            past 10 years and I am hungering for new, harder problems to sink my
            teeth into.

            Quordle at the beginning of 2022 as a fun side project. My friends
            and I found Wordle to be too easy, so I made Quordle to create a
            real challenge for ourselves. Quordle's popularity exploded over the
            next couple months and reached 2 million active daily players.
            Later, Merriam Webster offered to acquire Quordle and the
            announcement of the acquisition was written about on many news
            sites.<br />Quordle website:
