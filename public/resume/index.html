            Hi, I am a software engineer! I enjoy skiing, biking, hiking, and
            video games. But most of all, I love to code. I have the most
            experience in Android, Javascript (front-end and back-end), 3D
            graphics programming, and Python. The challenge of discovering and
            building amazing UI experiences is what drives me. Developing a UI
            into a cohesive and intentional experience is incredibly satisfying
            and I have accomplished this process across many different interface
            paradigms (Mobile, Web, Desktop, VR/AR).
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter the field or technology stack, I strive to learn, grow,
            and excel to create the best user experiences and most polished
            products possible!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently building games and working on personal projects after
            selling Quordle to Merriam-Webster, but I am always on the lookout
            for any fun new challenges that I can sink my teeth into.
